0,1,Don't buy these,"I have had these for about 2 days now and they are already lost. I want to start out by saying that I take extremely good care of my hardware, buying something expensive matters to me so I always take the time to treat my electronics properly. That being said, if you drop these from standing height, the case is going to open when it hits the ground. Yesterday, I had a scare where the case fell out of my pocket and the buds went flying. I found them, but this time I wasn't so lucky. The awkwardly shaped case is prone to slipping out of my pocket, which it did, and the buds shot out again but I had no clue where they went. I am extremely disappointed and have now wasted $100 because a protective case couldn't do its job."
1,2,"Great headphones, but didn't deliver on the killer feature","I'll be honest, I _want to like these headphones_. The audio is amazing, the headphones are comfortable, the battery life is good, the case charging them is great, the touch features are intuitive and everything is well with the world.Except for the 60 ms delay claim. That's why I bought these -- with the 3.5 mm headphone jack becoming an endangered species gaming on android in public with sound just hasn't been viable. Bluetooth audio lag is totally unacceptable for gaming. When I got these the first thing I did was pair them with my Razer phone 2 and fired up d-touch (a doom port) and there was no discernable difference between gaming mode and non gaming mode.Unfortunately I'm going to have to return these. I really do enjoy them for music and audio where a/v sync isn't important, but given they can't deliver the killer feature they promised, I kind of have to return them on principle and stick with my cheaper set of skull candies."
2,3,Good quality sound with some interesting and almost poor design choices.,"I've gone through about 3 bluetooth earbuds this month, mind of testing some out. Two of them being 30 dollar pairs and this one being 100. So I'll kind of go over comparing these to cheaper alternatives.Pros:Good sound quality compared to cheaper designs. There are nice highs and solid bass. They aren't as bassy as some might prefer but the sound quality is definitely not lacking.Very easy and intuitive pairing compared to some. You don't have to pair each earbud or do any janky swapping to use only one earbud at a time, you just open the case up, pair them and then you're good to go for either side.Easy control scheme, first set that I didn't have to read the manual to figure out how to switch songs. (some BTs use some weird control schemes)Slim case that doesn't feel like a burden to carry in my pocket.The passive noise cancelation is nice and helps block out some of the noise. There are definitely better noise canceling headphones but these aren't awful for the price.Cons:Terrible button for controls. Idk why they decided to use a touch control on the earbuds with no feedback. Often I find myself having to continuously feel for the sweet spot to be able to pause or unpause my songs.Lower battery life. 3 hour life with only 12 hour charging from the case. (but that's probably because of the smaller casing)No RGB. Like come on Razer.Terrible connection when put in my pocket. Can't even walk around with my phone in pocket without losing all connection.So-So:The gaming mode has only made a slight change in the games I've tested. I know that's the main draw of these, so I was kind of bummed to find that it really only helped in certain games and didn't seem like it made all that much of an impact. I could see a difference in Mario kart, but in COD: mobile there was barely any difference in latency. I'm not sure if its because of my phone or not though. I have to confirm if my phone has Bluetooth 5.0, which might be leading factor in why I get no benefit. If I can find a phone with 5.0 BT I'll probably update this.The design of the earbuds is kind of odd to me. If you don't like gummies you'll probably enjoy it more than me. However, if you have a small ear, you will not find these comfortable. They sit flush in your ear but I found them hard to stay in without a lot of adjusting and sometimes they started to hurt the cartlidge above my ear.Overall, I've enjoyed the sound quality and the easy of use they provide, but in terms of price to performance, there are definitely better and cheaper alternatives. The gaming mode in theory is a great idea, but if you don't have a 5.0 BT device, I'd avoid these. I like them enough for a 4 star review but if there was a 3.5 I'd probably put them there."
3,5,Excellent sound quality!!,"I absolutely love these earphones! They look great and they sound great! The 13mm drivers definitely deliver clean, clear, and crisp sound with deep satisfying bass! Pairing was easy and I like how they auto connect. The volume was kinda low at first which was really weird. The volume was maxed out on my phone and they barely got loud enough. I almost returned them but then I reconnected them and now they can get beyond loud enough. I listen to them set at 50%. It only happened the very first time I connected them. The connection is good. Only a few times where they started to cut out on me but most of the time it's a solid connection. They are very similar to airpods. They just sit in ur ear and don't actually go into the ear canal which is great becuz I can wear them for a lot longer without getting fatigue but then again becuz of their design they're not really noise isolating. I think that's a good thing tho becuz I like to where them at work and still be able to hear my co workers and customers around me. The case definitely isn't the greatest.. Honestly it feels kinda cheap and it scratches easily and it is very slick too. Also the right earbud goes on the left side which was weird at first but now I prefer the cross draw. The touch controls are capacitive which is okay but I prefer physical button. I have many headphones and these are one of my favorites due to the fact the sound quality is excellent! Totally worth it and highly recommended."
4,5,Affordable and Balanced Media Headphones,"I already have a pair of $350 Sony Noise cancelling headphones that I use during flights, but I was looking for something that I can simply wear during long walks that are sweat resistant.  These are the perfect complement to my iPhone 11 ProThese are not the best for just  Audio, but balanced more than enough to justify their price tag.1. Audio is good. 4/52. Sweat resistant3. The gaming more actually works pretty well. Low latency is amazing, even a plus when watching video. The audio actually matches the lips of the actors.4. Comfortable  during an hour walk. 4/5 and a good seal.5. Treble is good, nice details. Mids are good. Footsteps and gunshots are easy to hear. Not bass heavy. Mic is above average. Overall, extremely balanced."
5,1,Don't buy these it's a disappointment,This isn't worth near $100 this is literal crap feels like a Chinese clone. Connection is so bipolar I can have my phone 4 inches away and it will still disconnect within a minute after connecting. These headphones don't fit in your ear and they end up hurting your ears after like an hour of use and the gummies don't help at all they even make it worse since it's cheap. The charging case is also of the cheapest material it may look nice but once you have it in your hands you can tell on the spot. The quality of the sound is great so much more bass than airpods but most of the time you will just be listening to any song or audio just being butchered because of how bad the connection is. I love razer and their products but this seems as a cash grab.
6,2,Gaming Mode isn't good enough,"I bought these because my favorite game on Android is Thumper, which as a rythm game is extremely latency sensitive. i had been using a pair of galaxy buds occasionally and Thumper was unplayable with them compared to any of my wired buds.So i bought the Hammerhead True Wireless because they are advertised as having much lower latency. unfortunately, however lower the ""Gaming Mode"" latency is than the galaxy buds for instance it's still way too high latency. the audio cues in-game that are before actions on wired headphones are after the actions need to be done even in ""Gaming Mode"" on the Hammerhead True Wireless. They're just not good enough for gaming.connection drops do happen often enough that it's an annoyance but not often enough that I can't actually use them, and sometimes they can go hours without a hitch.As for sound quality, the mids are very forward in a fun sort of way, and the bass is surprisingly full for a non-sealed bud, but there's totally real pierce on the highs, and as for the bass, while it's not muddy at all it's boomy. and the slight quiet hiss many bt earbuds have is here too. not the worst i've heard, but not really good per se.my dissatisfaction isn't really about the sound quality, Razer isn't a audiophile company, the sound is fine for what it is, my disappointment is based on the fact that the reason i bought them, and the thing they are marketed on, being low enough latency for gaming, they just are not at all good enough at."
7,3,"Great price, decent sound quality, horrible microphone","I purchased the Hammerhead True Wireless for a few key reasons.  I wanted no wires, at least 4 hours of music/talk time, and decent audio fidelity (as measured by airpods as a baseline).Likes:- No wires!- Decent sound quality for small earbuds, bass included. Sound slightly better than airpods, mids are fantastic, and bass is reasonable.- Plenty loud, go too loud in my opinion.- Battery life: I'm getting ~5 hours- Black color is nice alternative to the Apple white.- Comfortable enough- $99 price is attractiveWhat's OK:- Touch controls.  nice to have them but they are also finicky.  At times i experience delayed response to touch input. Play/pause isn't just a tap, there is a required dwell time so it's more like touch and hold for 1 sec vs. Tap to pause.  I end up fumbling with it when i want to pause and end up skipping tracks.  Muscle memory should help over time.-  Did some research on gaming mode and sounds like more of a gimmick.  Haven't tried it yet personally so jury is still out.Dislikes:- Plastic for the case and earbuds is below typical Razer quality.  Looks cheap, feels cheap. I expected at least the charging case to be anodized aluminum.- Don't always stay in my ears well because the cheap plastic is slippery. They are slightly textured in comparison to Airpods smooth premium plastic. Its counter-intuitive but the smoother airpod plastic grabs and stays put much better.- Microphone is virtually useless.  On test calls and test audio recordings the mic picked up background noise better than my voice.  TV on low  in the background, 10 feet away, and you could hear the broadcast word for word while my voice wasn't always clear. There is no way i could take a phone call in a noisy environment or attempt to use these for conference calls.  If this is a ""for gamers, by gamers"" product they obviously didn't test this in a live voice chat scenario.  During PC gaming the mic would pick up each keystroke and mouse click. Hoping they push a firmware update to address the poor mic quality. if not, i'll probably have to return and stick with the pixel buds which have great sound quality, battery life, and a stupid cord."
8,2,Any sudden moves and they fall right out of your ears.,"The silicone sleeves that come in the box do nothing. I wanted a pair of earbuds to run in. The second I started running, the left earbud flew off my head. After it skidded across a length of road, the plastic had a few ugly nicks in it. I popped it back in and made sure it was situated nice and snug, and then took off running again and the right earbud fell out. This time I was expecting it, so I caught it and then carefully walked back to my house to get a beanie to pull over my ears so these headphones would stay in. Before getting that beanie out of my closet I wrote this review, during which time one earbud or the other would start falling out of my ear if I swallowed or moved my jaw in a certain way. That wasn't a joke, it literally happened. It's a shame, because I wanted to like these. They both look and sound fine, which is more than you can say for 90% of the other wireless earbuds out there right now. And before you write off this review because you think my ears are enormous, I've been wearing wired earbuds my whole life without a problem. Unfortunately, these earbuds are just not quite good enough. Maybe they'll get it right if they make Hammerheads 2."
9,5,Enjoying the  Hammerheads....But!!!,So far enjoying them I wish there was a volume for the headphones on themselves it fits my ears pretty good hey don't fall off they feel pretty secure and come with this two little rubber tips sleeves in case you want to put them on the headphones to Fill more secure but so far  they sound good but I did notice that they don't sound too loud on my LG thin Q7 phone but they sound a lot more louder on my old Samsung Galaxy Edge 7 phone but overall they sound good in both phones
10,1,I've bought Razer countless times but man did they mess up,"These are the worst airpod rip offs I've used hands down. Coming from airpods g1 and the soundcore liberty airs g1, the wireless hammerheads are a travesty of wasted potential. It has THE cheapest plastic on the market used for the case, that's understandable I guess. But they don't stop there, they use the SAME plastic for the actual headphones it's disgusting. The headphones are so quiet I can't hear any music in public. As an avid fan of Razer products this is just disappointed on levels I didn't believe this company can reach"
11,4,Great quality sound & battery but low volume.,"Personally use them for the gym and when taking walks in public. The connectivity is awsome, they pair up as soon as you take them out the case. The sound quality is also really clear and won't be disappointed. The case battery life is also pretty good and percentage on my phone is accurate.Cons: Apart from not having noise cancelling, which I don't mind, I definitely did not like the low volume. It's just loud enough to hear everything but you have something loud going on in your environment like the gym and wish that you could increase it by 2 or 3 levels.Always been happy with most Razer products but I honestly wouldn't recommend these if you want loud music you can emerse yourself into.Hopefully these get a firmware update where they increase the volume and have an actual equalizer in there app because it's really basic."
12,3,My honest opinion,"These are good Earbuds, however there are a few things I think are important before buying. First and most importantly the reason im contemplating sending these back. These are not very comfortable earbuds, they're a lot bigger than most earbuds (at least what im used too from apple) so after about an hour of wearing they start to really hurt your ears. My other biggest issue is the touch on them feels really inconsistent. One tap for pause, double tap for song skip, triple for replay. I could tap them twice for a song skip and theyll pause or i could tap them once for a pause and ill get nothing. The touch feels really bad on these. The sound is amazing, i will say they're some of the loudest and best noise canceling earbuds ive ever used, although the noise cancellation is only noticeable because you're over powering everything around you with the level of sound they can produce, which is good i suppose. The other issue I have is that they dont have a way to adjust volume wirelessly. So in order to do that you'd need to have whatever device they're connected within in arms reach, which to me seems a little counter intuitive. They have pretty decent range, I work in a warehouse with a lot of walls, sometimes i try and leave my phone in a room and walk outside whilst listening to whatever it may be and they'll cut out. The range is okay, but youll need to be in the same room to use them effectively. Ive not yet used them with games, but i think the level of sound they can produce as i mentioned eariler would make them pretty good actually.  The battery, and honestly i haven't purchased a lot of airpods but from what i know vs my friends pairs. These last quite a bit longer, But it could be due to the fact that my are recently purchased. Id trust them for at least 4-5 hours. Overall great earbuds, I didnt shop around much but if i could the only reason id buy a different set is if they had a way to adjust volume on the earbud itself and if the touch responses worked better. If you can find something cheaper with better reviews, id purchase those vs these."
13,5,LITERALLY BUY THEM NOW,"I haven't been much of a Razer fan really, but once I bought their phone, I started to realize that the company's no joke, however when i purchased these earbuds... I thought the company could travel time travel, because WOW these sound brilliant.All jokes aside, if you are looking into buying premium flagship wireless, that deliver everything you need in an affordable price these are PERFECT. They have excellent bass, and with razer's Dolby Atmos App, it works even better. There is a great balance between the high's mid's and low's, the connection is as smooth and as fast as I thought it would be, and the response time without ""gaming mode"" is exactly like airpods, so when ""gaming mode"" is enabled, it's super fast. And I do have to say the click to the case is pretty damn satisfying. Of course these don't have  noise cancelling, but when the volume is even at medium almost all of the excess noise is removed, besides like standing next to a train of course (however if you are in that situation, just turn the volume almost all the way up).CONCLUSION:These are the BEST and most trustworthy $100 wireless earbuds out right now (by reliable brand). So pick these up for luxurious sound quality and elegant everything."
14,2,Will stop playing if overwhelmed,"I love razer products, I use their mamba wireless mouse, huntsman elite keyboard, and even the orbweaver chroma and I love all these products. That being said, I cannot recommend these earbuds.Pros- gaming mode works incredibly, almost no lag- the touch settings are easy enough to use, but aren't so sensitive I set them off every time I adjust the earbuds.- They pair and connect the second the case is opened.Cons- uncomfortable in my ear. I kind of have smaller ears, so when I smile or laugh while wearing these it really hurts.- the battery life is kind of short on gaming mode, only lasts a few hours and might left earbud always dies before I even get a low battery warning in the right earbud.- the mic on these are absolutely terrible and ultimately is just a waste of hardware space.- wherever the audio is quite I can hear the device itself making noise in the right earbud which is very distracting.- MOST IMPORTANTLY it seems that when there are multiple different loud sounds, they just stop working for a couple seconds? The audio will cut out and I can't hear anything for about 2 seconds. This will happen every few minutes and for earbuds oriented towards gaming, that is terrible. I play Rainbow Six Siege a lot by the way, and this is where I experience this problem consistently.Overall the sound is decent, pretty uncomfortable, gaming mode works and is very nice, but the frequency of the audio cutting out and the electronic grinding like sounds in the right earbud are terrible. Stray away from this razer product."
15,5,I recommend these!,These are not extremely comfortable but I decided I don't care because they sound so good.  I listened to videos I've already watched and heard so many new things!  I haven't tried a lot of buds but I'm willing to bet these are the best for the price.  The only thing difference for the extra $100 dollars on the others is wireless charge case but I don't consider that essential.  They even work separately which is awesome for battery life although the best sound is with both in.  I recommend these. They look cool too.
16,5,Great Earbuds,"I've been using these for a little bit over a month and they have been really good. When I first got them they were amazing, the sound quality was great and the range was crazy. I gave one to my friend while we were in a Walmart so we could both listen to music and she went about 2-3 aisles away from me and she said the song didn't drop out at all. That was using an S8+ and I did notice some dropping when I would leave my phone upstairs when I would just go downstairs for a second but since then I've gotten a OnePlus 7 Pro and I can go anywhere in my house with my phone in my room and it doesn't drop at all, so I guess that is more based on your phone than the headphones. Sound quality is great though and the only thing I could think of to make them better is if they could go in the shower safely."
17,5,On Point,"These are perfect for me. I had apple earbuds prior to these.  I like these better. They can not connect to multiple devices at the same time.  Also note IF YOU ARE A GAMER, Bluetooth (any version) does not work with games and discord (or any other voice comms program) at the same time as a game because of a windows limitation currently. So if you use a side app for communications while playing with friends I would not suggest these as a solution.  Bass is good, sound clarity is good, no noticeable latency.  Battery life is more than enough and I listen to audio books all the time and use them to talk on the phone."
18,5,Pleasantly surprised,"I am admittedly a massive Razer fan. I was in the market for a small pair of earbuds so I didn't have to pack up a pair of over ear headphones when I wanted to go mobile. I had tried some competitive wired earbuds, but couldn't ever seem to find a pair that fit and were comfortable. I didn't expect any ear buds to match a good pair of headphones in performance. Wow, was I pleasantly surprised to find these wireless buds that fit so well and sound so good right out of the box. Noise cancellation would have been a bonus, but at the price, these are a no brainer for people looking for an air pods like experience for Android."
19,5,Get your money's worth!,"Althought people have gone pretty hard about the battery life and the sound quality I personally have enjoyed this earbuds since my day of purchase. I drive for a living and have never had a problem with them running out of battery. They don't hurt and the price couldn've been better. I there was some companion app to download but so far i haven't found one so i can mess around with the EQ. The noise cancelation is good, but not the best. Overall I would highly recommend this product and if you have any questions feel free to ask."
20,2,Decent battery life and sound quality but mired by poor connection issues,"The connection on these earbuds are quite bad. Even if I have my phone in my hand in front of my face, a simple slight turn of my head will result in these earbuds disconnecting and stuttering. Also, these earbuds are very temperamental even with putting my phone in my front pocket. Battery life is decent for their size, but I can't recommend since they stutter with the most generous of scenarios and in common usage."
21,5,A sound system!,"Working great, and he doesn’t answer me when I ask him questions so the noise canceling must be working! Ha! And he hasn’t lost them yet, yay!"
22,3,Razer true wireless earbuds,Pros:  The sound quality is great the best bass I've heard in wireless earbuds. The battery life is on par with other wireless ear buds. I like how compact the case is and all the multi touch options it has compared to other earbuds.Cons:  The rubber ear tips that come with the buds don't stay on very well. After long periods of listening to the buds it would hurt my ears with or with out the rubber tips.
23,2,Sound quality is great when you play games solely.,A decent product. It would be better if the sound enhancements worked overall and not just for games. It would be a sweet pair of headphones if there were sound adjustment options like treble and bass but it's ok. A decent pair but a overall miss.
24,2,"I'm glad I got them on sale, because they don't hold up","I bought this in conjunction with my razer phone. It has a realistic Bluetooth range of like 10 feet, and doesn't work at all if your phone is in your pocket. If you're running, or there's even a slight breeze, they drop connection. They sounded great for a few days, but then the volume dropped so much that if someone has a conversation in the same room I can't hear my music. The function keys either don't work, or they perform the wrong function."
25,5,Great for the price!,"Let me preface by saying that these sounds absolutely incredible! They sound better then the standard headphones that apple products come with, that is for sure! A lot of people on here are complaining about the build quality of the case but i honestly don't think its that bad, im also looking into buying a silicone case just for an extra layer of protection :). Hands down worth the money!"
26,1,"Not worth the price, Galaxy Buds are better.","They have good battery life, and sound quality. BUT it still isn't worth the price tag. The case quality is very cheap, they don't fit well in the ears, and the touch sensor on the side isn't very responsive."
27,4,"Does what I need, but not what I want.",I use these every day but will probably get the Pixel Buds 2 once they are out for the better assistant integration.
28,5,Great Earbuds,"I am really enjoying these earbuds. I use them almost everyday. When I'm running, doing dishes, or at work. These are my favorite earbuds and I'll probably buy another pair I can leave at my desk at work because I hate the days I leave them at home on accident."
29,1,poor sound,"it wasn't the sound i was seeking. too low, not enough bass."
30,4,Decent True Wireless Headphones,"Good Stuff //-Decent battery life-Decent audio quality for music and calls [but don't expect heavy bass, lol]-Lightweight & sweat resistantBad Stuff //-Awkward tactile/button press controls = 'The headphones have an app to help with firmware updates, etc. Inside the app was tutorial for button presses to bring out voice assistant, pause/play track & skip...and I always get the timing wrong. It shouldn't be this clumsy to handle these few options.""-The case is cheaply made = ""I have been careful with it and it already has scratches and smudges. I wish they had opted for a rubberized or a matte look for the case. I would def use the included lanyard, as this little case is easy to misplace.""-Layout of headset case is weird = "" Left side houses the right ear and vice versa..what is wrong with right side with ride headset and vice versa...""Wished it had // [Maybe next version]-Noise Cancellation-Wireless Charging for the case-RGB on the headset and the case for fun/coolness-Small speaker on the case, so you can locate it with Razer app...."
31,2,Could have been great,"I got these in hopes of finding a wireless earbud solution for my Twitch stream so that I would have the option to wear a hat or just not getting headset hair from my Arctis Pro Wireless. I wanted a pair of earbuds that were wireless and low latency so that I could still play games without the massive delay that bluetooth usually comes with. I had hoped that the so called ""Gaming Mode"" on these would do the trick. Sadly I can say it does not. I bought these and another pair of APTX LL earbuds to see if either would work for my needs and then compared the latency of the Razer in both Gaming and non-gaming modes to the APTX LL model as well as a baseline from my Arctis. The APTX LL earbuds were only 22ms slower than my Arctis which wasn't too bad honestly but then the Razer IN ""Gaming Mode"" were 82ms slower than my Arctis! Even if the latency had been acceptable the 4 hour max battery life is just too short for most streams anyway so all-in-all these are a big no for me."
32,5,Best Bluetooth headphones I’ve ever owned!,"When I saw these headphones be unveiled by Razer I immediately knew I wanted them. Finally purchased as a birthday present. I have to admit I was going off the brand name when I bought them and didn’t take the time to read reviews beforehand. I read many reviews in each rating bracket and was still confident that I made a good purchase.Design: these have a similar design to AirPods or any Apple headphone which I like because they fit inside my ears the best. My wife has some Skull Candy headphones that I have to push deep into my ears and I do not enjoy that. I will say the touch controls on the outside of the headphones are a little too sensitive. I’ve paused or restarted what I’m listening to because I put my finger on the touch control when removing the headphones.Battery: I’ve seen a 4 hour range from a few people and that’s about what I got out of them before I charged them for the first time.Sound: I saw MANY reviews saying these headphones weren’t loud enough for them. THESE ARE NOT NOISE CANCELING HEADPHONES!! I’m a mechanic and work in a loud shop so my hearing isn’t the best, but I can’t have the sound up more then 1/2 way up. It’s just too loud for me. You can download the app for these headphones and adjust the sound on there. The sound quality is outstanding as well. I haven’t tried the gaming mode as I don’t play too many video games anymore. There is also no 1 second lag between video and sound when you watch a video on YouTube or Disney+. It’s crisp and clear.Bluetooth: easy to set up with an iPhone. I also saw many reviews saying the headphones would disconnect or cut in and out of their phone was in their pocket. I’ve had zero problems with that. I left my phone in my room and walked to the other side of my house and they were still connected. So the range is very good, the app says the range is good for 10 meters or about 30 feet. I’d say that is correct.Overall I am very happy and satisfied with this purchase! $99 is a great price for this product. I’d gladly buy them again."
33,3,Excellent sound without blocking you off from the world! Slight problem of multi-device support.,"Update to my original review:The inability to connect to multiple devices (phone, tablet, etc)  and seemlessly switch back and forth between them has proven to be quite a nuisance. Thes are great earbuds for sure, but if you are like me, and are constantly using multiple devices for work or otherwise, that is the one thing that might hold you back.Original Review:I have tried a number of solutions recently including Samsung Galaxy Buds, Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2, Airpods (I had those for about a year). I personally like the form factor of Airpods, because of the ease of putting them in your ears and back in the case. The stem makes them easy to handle. I also think the stem design seems better for calls, getting the mic just a bit closer to your mouth. I also like earbuds without a silicone tip going in your ear. I realize the Airpods Pro might have resolved the vacuum effect, but literally all other earbuds that use a silicone tip make the vacuum effect happen. I know some like that for cutting out ambient noise, but I find it uncomfortable. I like hearing at leas a little bit of what's around me, and not feeling like my ears are plugged up. The Razer Hammerhead earbuds, in my opinion, offer the best of both worlds: easy to put in your ears quickly, and then back in the case (though the case lid is sometimes difficult to open with short nails), but great sound without plugging up your ears!The fit is also nice. I know this is a personal thing, but if you like how the original Airpods fit, then ad to that the fact that these earbuds also come with a silicone sleeve which can help fit bigger ears. I use the sleeve and find it comfortable but snug (the original Airpods did move around a bit for me, but weren't too bad).They connect VERY QUICKLY! As soon as you open the lid, they are already connecting, and I usually heare the ""connected"" notification before I actually have one of the buds in my ear!I rated ""Noise cancellation"" 4 stars in this review, because they don't have active cancellation, which I don't care about, but they do get super loud! I'm listening to most things at about 50% volume comfortably, whereas my Airpods were always jacked to 100% and still not as loud as 50% on these earbuds. Bass is good and everything is clear. I suggest using your phone's EQ setting rather than the Razer app. I know Samsung has great EQ settings now including a ""Custom"" option.Improvement suggestions: I'd like the option to change tap functionality. It's already great, but I'd like to be able to change it to my liking, and also allow for volume control. Also, I'd like to see quicker switching from one device to another. You currently need to turn off bluetooth on the currently connected device to switch to another. on Android I do that and then us a phenomenal app called ""Bluetooth Audio Device Widget - Connect, Volume"" to force connection on the other device. You can use it as a widget or even have a Quick Panel Tile for the same functionality. It's great!"
34,2,Headache Inducing Earphones,"I really wanted to like these. It was a great price and I've always been a fan of Razer products, but I absolutely could not get these to work.Pairing was fine and sound quality is pretty good. However, the controls on these things have a mind of their own. Play/pause on 1 tap almost never worked. Since the first try didn't work, I would try again but then this registered as 2 taps which skipped the song. Sometimes, even that didn't work and it would register as 3 taps, which would replay/go back! When I took 1 earphone out, touching the sides would trigger it to play/pause and I could not find the same spot that triggered it. It was just completely random.The issues were just way too much for me to ignore. I'm definitely returning these."
35,5,What I was looking for!,"As an Android and Chromebook user, I've been wanting an airpod like headset for some time. I've tried airpods as well as a couple like them (ticpods, soundcore, soundpeats), but they don't quite work as they should with my devices. The sound quality of the Hammerhead is much better than airpods, and the fit is about the same. I appreciate the silicone tips, which keep them seated in my ears while riding my bike. I use them for both my Pixel 3 and Pixelbook Go. The only downside is that the case's cover could be better. I've found that battery life is much longer than 3 hours. I've listened to music for much of the day at times, and never ran out of battery."
36,3,Good but not great.,"They're a good value for the price with some big downsides. If those dont bother you too much then they're fine.Pros:- Loud and clear until turned up all the way. Lots of bass. I usually keep them on the lowest volume level at work or when running.- Gaming mode works. It reduces latency by a large amount. It's not good enough for competitive gaming though. Casual is fine.Cons:- Battery life is bad compared to other earbuds in 2020. Gaming mode cuts it down to <3 hours. Normal mode gets between 3 and 5.- Connection is weak. It will cut out occasionally if left in my pants pocket.- Case feels flimsy- Equalizer app is mediocre. Bass mode makes them sound muddy. Treble mode makes them sound like they're playing through a pringles can.- Included silicon covers fall off easily after a few weeks. I lost one after a month.- Wrist strap is too small unless you're a 12 year old girl.- Touch controls are bad. They are very finicky to the point I try to avoid touching them except to activate gaming mode.- Default AAC codec.Things to consider:- There is no noise isolation. This isn't a pro or con depending on your needs and expectations.- The fit is almost the exact same as airpods. If those work well for you, these will too.These are decent earbuds if you listen to music or play games for short bursts. Do not expect long session from them. They work surprisingly well for workouts as long as you dont keep the phone in your pocket."
37,3,Not the AirPods Replacement I Hoped For...,"I recently switched from iOS to Android so I had to pick up a set of wireless earbuds that charge via USB C to replace my AirPods.The sound quality is outstanding. Way better than the Gen 1 AirPods. Seriously, they sound crazy good.The battery life kind of sucks, but I don't use them for super long periods of time so I don't really run into issues very often.I had high hopes for these, but they simply do not compare to the fit and finish of the AirPods. They aren't as comfortable or as well built. The case is kind of janky (when compared to AirPods) and the lid can pop open sending your buddy flying if you use the lanyard.I will be trying the upcoming Pixel Buds to see if those are a better fit for me."
38,5,"Everything you expect from a Razer product, and more.","The last earbuds I'll probably ever buy. They don't have the low end power I'd like but they have everything else. And they fit any ear. My left one keeps trying to fall out but that's my ears fault. Seemless pairing, no latency that I've noticed, never drop out, battery life is awesome and the charge case (though I'm convinced it was made backwards) charges quickly and charges the headphones quickly. All in all, everything and more that I expect from a Razer product. Honestly, only bought it through Amazon because I wanted them now. My phone's bought from the Razer website took almost 3 weeks. My earbuds were at my door in 2 days. Amazon, doing a good job. And Razer, keep up the good work."
39,3,65ms NOT GOOD ENOUGH!,"To be advertised as a gaming headset...  ...it better perform.  These DO NOT!!!Does it have less lag? Yes.  Is it good enough for PUBG mobile or COD?  NOOOOOOO!!!!!Until Qualcomm brings back Low Latency codec to Aptx, and then supports that in mobile devices, pleas le do not waste your time with wireless headphones.Curse Apple for starting the whole ""cut out the 3.5 jack"" campaign.  But curse Android markets even more for following suit and not listening to their customers.Rant over.lolSeriously, if you play some sort of RPG mobile game, you don't really need low latency anyways.  If you play FPS games, these will not be enough.Also, comfort.  For my ears, these were terrible.  Worst earbuds I've ever used. Sound volume sucked, base was abnormally muddy.These headphones are terrible even if they were $20, but  #&@+_;""+!,  they're FREAKING $100!!!No thanks."
40,4,Definetly with it,Just got started I'm very impressed with the product always am a fan of razer.ProsSound is quite wellGame-mode alternativeCase has a magnet for the cover and the earbuds. Plus comes with a lanyard.USB is nylon and has dust coversConsOnly one silicone earbud no extras with wing tipsCant control volume with earbuds only volume control with your phone or ext.Other then that very nice product.
41,4,They are on,Some times you have to disconnect and reconnect because the signal starts fading don't know if it's the phone or the earbudsBoth brand new razer phone 2 and hammerhead bought at the same time
42,2,Terrible bluetooth,At first i was so excited to get these thinking I could replace the airpods with these but they are so inconsistent! They cut off all the time for no reason ill put my phone in my pocket while listening to music and they cut in and out over and over again. They feel nice and sound good but thats only when they actually connect.
43,4,Good sound when they have a connection,"Easy to use and good sound when the connection doesn't fade out. It seems to happen when I'm outdoors and the Bluetooth signal can't bounce around to the earbuds. Even with my phone in my front pocket and in my hand while hiking/running, the signal fades out then returns when my hand is in front of me. Other than that they are great earbuds if yours going to be indoors and stationary when outdoors."
44,5,Really good Razer Earbuds!,"Best earbuds I've ever used, people complain about the battery life, but I personally never use them for more than 1-1/2 hour at a time so its great, the sound quality is really good, but not to the level of my Status Audio CB-1 that I got for $40 cheaper, but the convenience, comfort, & SUPER ease of use makes this an excellent set of earbuds for me"
45,2,"Short life, short Bluetooth range","The right ear bud just plain doesn't work while my phone is in my pocket anymore. I've had the earbuds for about a month now and about a week ago they worked great! No issues whatsoever. Now, all of a sudden, the right ear bud has a super low Bluetooth range. I've tried plugging everything in to make sure it wasn't the battery being low, but now that they're fully charged, it's the same issue. I can't walk around with my phone in my pocket and listen to music through both earbuds anymore. Pretty disappointing."
46,5,👍🏻👍🏻,"I found them to be more comfortable than I thought they would be, very light weight which helps. I saw people complain about them being cheap feeling, I didn't see this, but the weight almost makes you want to think this."
47,5,Same razer quality,"Update 1/1/2020 Firmware update + companion app with EQ presets are amazing. No joke with treble boost feels like i am cheating i can hear like i have comtacs on.I bought the original wired hammer heads and still have them, but decided to go wireless. Best choice by far the only problem i have is the battery life. From my experience so far after a hour work out and low latency use for about two to three hours of gaming has me in the yellow which is only half charge so it's not bad at all."
48,3,Disappointed!! 😕,"Razer you made me disappointed. Mediocre sound, I expected more from you. But unfortunately it was not so. I'm not one of the people who make bad comments, but $ 99 must have been worth it."
49,4,Good but could be better.,"I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one, and now I finally do. The first week I'm using this one for listening to music and gaming, it was fine. The sound quality is good tho it doesn't have noise cancellation. Battery life is awesome. But the one thing I'd say on this one is that it hurts my ears. Am I putting it on wrong? Does anyone have the same experience as well?"
50,5,"A solid, functional wireless earbud","I'm coming from using first-gen AirPods so I have limited experience with these types of products.These feel and sound amazing. I tried using Amazon Echo Buds but had to gift them to my wife, as the inner-ear style just doesn't work well for me.These feel like the traditional AirPods style in the ear. Obviously some people like that and others do not but I prefer them.Pairing is easy, as you just tap and hold into pairing mode. You can also pair them while they're in the case.I tested gaming mode both on my laptop and on my mobile device (Android) and it worked flawlessly. No issues with desynced audio or any type of distortion. To activate gaming mode, you tap three times and hold on the third. You do the same to disengage it.I'm impressed with the case. It's quite different than what the AirPods use. Has a charging light indicator. I REALLY like how it's a USB-C port. One thing that's included is a strap that attaches to the side... it's not something I thought I wanted in a carrying / charging case until I have it.Haven't had enough time to really get into battery. I know based on specs it's a bit lower than some competing products... time will tell through every day use. Will update this review based on usage.There you have it! Solid, functional wireless earbuds in an AirPods style that costs a fair amount less. Five stars for now!"
51,1,Awful Bluetooth connection,"As some one who almost solely uses Razer products I had high hopes for these and was so excited to get them. I had the hammerhead BT and love those but these are just not up to par at all. I could never have a consistent connection. As soon as I put my phone in my pocket, they would cut in and out every second."
52,5,Gaming Mode Works,"These are now my main headphones that I will carry on me daily. I also own Jabra 65t Elite. I almost didn't buy these because on paper the 65t should be superior but me being a big fan or Razer, I just had to try these. I'll let others talk about audio quality since I'm not an audiophile and music playback is good enough for me. I want to share a specific use case of mineThe game mode works. I paired it with the HomeSpot Bluetooth adapter for Nintendo Switch and with game mode disabled, it has the same lag that I get with the Jabra 65t Elite. Turning on game mode, it is pretty much lag free. Don't know how they did it because the HomeSpot adapter says it is connected with SBC codec (which has the most delay compared to aptX and aptX-LL). Played Overwatch and it was like I had wired headphones plugged in. I don't own an aptX headset so can't compare with that.I also took an unexpected phone call while using these at the grocery store this weekend. The person on the other line didn't complain about not hearing me or background noise. I actually get the opposite experience with my Jabra 65t Elite so I stopped using them for phone calls. I don't intend to use these as a main headset to take calls, but it is nice knowing that I could. (if it means anything, I use the OG Razer Phone)Also wanted to add that charging via USB-C is another reason the Jabra 65t is getting replaced as my daily one. I can finally stop carrying a micro-usb cord with me.The only ""weird"" thing I can think of is how you put the right ear piece in the left side of the carrying case and the left ear piece in the right side. It was weird to me at first, but I can see why they did it. Thinking if it was done the ""correct"" way with the same orientation, If you imagine holding the carrying case with your left hand to grab the right ear piece, you'd have to flip the ear piece in your fingers/hand before inserting into right ear. With how it is now, you don't have to do thatThe 65t will still have its uses for me. Because of its in-ear design, I'll keep using it for the superior noise cancellation when I want it (like when during work outside of the house and working out at the gym)"
53,5,Solid deal,"I always liked the sound profile from Razer after their first gen Kraken headphones. They didn’t claim the battery life of the earbuds themselves and I watched one review saying it’s 3 hours, from my testing it’s longer than 3, not too sure how long longer than 3 since I don’t wear them for that long every session. The lag is definitely really low, fit is great too. The biggest for these are probably the position of the microphones. Also they’re omnidirectional and no mentioning of noise cancelling, it basically picks up your voice and everyone else’s. I really like the case design though I wish they used their flagship CNC aluminum :p"
54,3,I really wanted to love these,"Let me start off by saying I'm a huge Razer fan. I was excited to get these as soon as they were available. All until i pulled the earbuds out of the box. The earbuds and case feel like cheap plastic. The plastic isn't seamless. The touch function doesn't always register the first. Usually takes a few tries. No premium feel at all which is disappointing. Not worth the $99 price tag. The sounds is actually pretty good. Plenty of bass. I'll hold onto them for a little while longer, but will most likely be returning them."
55,5,Very satisfied so far!,"Everything I expected and not a single issue so far. They paired quick and easy; I had zero hassel. Touch controls work exactly per instructions. The sound is great. The range is great. I feel immersed watching videos on my phone. I tested streaming video and music and I didn't notice any lag. I haven't tested games or the game mode function or battery life yet. But, I've been very pleased with them right out of the box."
56,3,Not bad but not great.,"The case holds the right ear bud on the left side and the left on the right, really???  What smart engineer came up with that one, and how did it get through design???  Overall they look good, comfortable, but sound mediocre."
57,5,Incredible so far!,"So far so good! Been using them for a little over an hour, I compare them to my AirPods and I honestly like these better. They fee a lot lighter and I like all the gestures that come with it too, on top of that they sound incredible!! The bass in it is awesome. Sounds just like my other razer headphones. Quick to connect and easy to use app."
58,1,was excited till i used them....,"The sound is an improvement over the older hammerhead BT headphones but... The touch controls are tough to use. I mean it took me serval tries to get this into gaming mode or to even pause. Its like the buds would get confused and would turn off while tring to pause. maybe I am just not used to such controls. This is just my experience thus far. Then there is the connections. On my phone the razer phone 2. the connections is solid while my phone is out say on a table or right in front of my while playing a game. Once my phone goes into  my pocket (pants pocket, jacket chest pocket, or even my backpack) the buds will have trouble keeping connection making listening to anything choppy. This same choppy connection I do experience while on my 2019 razer blade stealth... while its right in front of my. Now I own other Bluetooth headphones. Bose sound sport. the older hammerhead bt and an even older razer BT headphones (sorry I forget the name) and NONE of those have had any choppy connection problems like these buds."
59,5,Super happy with these. Comfortable and they Sound Great ... let me explain,"I originally learned about these Razer earbuds on a review from Chrome Unboxed YouTube channel. The guy there was impressed with the sound quality.I ordered a set from Amazon Warehouse (cuz I'm kinda cheap) and they arrived fast. Had to charge them up overnight, then got them paired after doing a firmware update (get the Razer Hammerhead app for your phone).Now brace yourselves, because I'm the kind of guy that is OK with Apple's wired earpods. I'm OK with the Apple-style fit, which these Hammerheads have. But the Hammerheads are way more comfortable. I've been wearing them on and off most of the day, and I don't have any discomfort or fatigue. The little stem thing sits nicely so these stay in my ears well. Very happy with the fit. Also they are black so they blend in a bit more than the bright white Airpods.And now the sound. I was quite pleasantly surprised. I messed with the EQ settings available in the Hammerhead app. But I didn't need to change the EQ. They sound great ""flat"" right out of the box. (I actually didn't care for the two EQ settings included in the app.)The sound is clear, balanced, the bass is very present but NOT hyped. Currently listening to Come Together by the Beatles. Paul's bass is very present but not overpowering, Ringo's bass drum thumps just a little bit (which is good for an old recording). I put on some Switchfoot and found the highs to be just a little bright, not terrible though. I had to back off the volume a bit. That could be the mix though, they are rockers.I put on some old Joy Division, Herbie Hancock, Michael Hedges, Wings, Chicago Transit Authority.. everything faithfully reproduced by these headphones. (Is this Bluetooth? It sounds so clear.)But then... one of my favorite records. New Order's ""Technique."" Fine Time starts out the album with about 8 seconds of electronic hi-hat. I always have this album turned up too loud at the beginning because the hi-hat is turned down a bit, and then BoOm! the bass line kicks in. Wow. It sounds Great in these little buds. And the highs are snappy too.I know it's my first day, but these are fun little earbuds, and I'm going to be glad to be free of the wire on my old headphones.Now a few cons:Some have complained that the case is a little tricky to open. It is a little annoying, you have to look at the case to see which side opens, but it's not a big deal. Some have also complained that the buds go in the case backwards (right on the left and left on the right). I got used to it pretty quickly, no big deal.The touch controls are taking a little getting used to, and may just be the nature of wireless buds. I've never used Airpods so I can't compare. The single-touch to pause has to be a bit deliberate. I could get skip track and go-back-a-track to work fine. I do miss having a volume control on the buds (which I did on my wired buds). But since the Bluetooth range isn't super range-y, I'll probably have my phone close by anyway, so I guess I can live with that. (I live in a old fortress of a house, so 20 to 25 feet seems to be all I'm getting for range. But I usually keep my phone on hand.)You can summon Siri with a long press on one of the buds, there's a bit of a delay, but I don't use that often enough to worry about it. I was able to ask Siri to turn the volume up and down, so I guess I could do that instead of adjusting the volume on my phone.TL;drGreat buds. Very comfortable, nice balanced sound but with plenty of bass. Good price, especially if you don't need the super-advanced features of Airpods (such as touch volume controls or Hey Siri)"
60,5,i adore these,"theyre slick and smooth and look so stealthy and nice.battery life isnt super high but its reasonable and ive never found myself with a dead pair when i want to use them and they always last me.there is no noise cancellation which isnt a problem for me personally, but may not be what youre looking for."
61,1,Very Uncomfortable to wear,"The hard plastic earpieces are very uncomfortable to wear. If you want ear buds you can wear more than an hour a day, look elsewhere.  Functionally, they worked and sounded fine."
62,1,it does not worth the trouble,"I shouldn't bought this phone, after a few weeks right side stopped working.  It is just a poor apple airpod copy."
63,4,Great but one problem,"The sound quality is great and touch controls actually work but my only problem is the connection. It does auto pair, but it keeps on disconnecting. It doesn’t bother me but from time to time it can be frustrating. But overall a great product. Everything works, including the gaming mode. Just wanted to tell the customers that keep in mind of this connection problem while they’re shopping for wireless earbuds"
64,5,Awesome crisp sound,These are great buds. They sound crisp and clean. Loved them so much I bought 12 for friends and family.
65,4,Good for gaming. A good price.,"very good sound quality the touch sensors work well and the game mode works very well, the diley is very small compared to others that can not even be played.The carrying case is of a very good size fits in the pocket are no problem, although the lid feels unfit if it is not for a magnet that holds it well it would have been alone."
66,1,They don’t live up to the hype! Poor battery life!,"Bought these with high hopes but they didn’t get passed a week before returning them. $100 and they last 2-3 hours on a full charge. Doesn’t matter if it’s low latency mode or not, 3 hours MAX. For being a gaming designed pair of wireless earbuds they don’t match up to the competition. Save yourself the hassle and get a pair with better sound quality and a longer battery life."
67,5,Value,The sound quality is great. Lots of bass. They connect as soon as the case is opened. There is no delay in sound in videos. Would recommend if anyone is looking for earphones to game with on the go.
68,1,Won't Play Simultaneously or Connect to their app,Terrible product! Won't play simultaneously and won't connect to the app designed for them.
69,5,Best apple alternative,If you love the Appke airpod shape but cant afford apple prices or want something in black then you should consider getting these. They feel amazing in my ears and have a rubber tip if you want to run without them falling out. They sound great and have an awesome battery life
70,3,Iffy,"I’d give them a better review if they didn’t want to randomly disconnect. But I find these pretty good not gonna lie.The sound quality is good and the silicone for the ear piece is a nice addition, but like I said above my only downside is when they want to disconnect randomly."
71,5,Awesome for the price,Love the fit of these and the battery can be charged so quickly and the times with the case normally get four to five times before I have to recharge the case and pods. They pick up all the sounds around you which can be bothersome at times.
72,5,Good stuff,Pretty dope headphones. Battery life could be better but so could my life.
73,3,Nothing special,There’s better out there in this price range or cheaper. Absolutely nothing special about these. Battery life sucks. Sound is good unless you’re listening to something with bass. The wrist strap won’t fit on anyone over the age 5yrs old.
74,5,Awesome wireless earbuds,These are awesome wireless earbuds. Same as airpods but way cheaper. The only thing the airpods have better is the case. Definitely recommend them!
75,2,THE AUDIO CUTS OFF WAYYYYYY TOO MUCH AND IT IS ANNOYING,"The earphones are good, don’t get me wrong, but only if you’re sitting and not really doing anything. When I’m walking and using them the audio ALWAYS cut off (when they’re in my pocket or anywhere below my chest). At first I thought I could get used to it, but NO; it is unbearable. Please take my word and DO NOT buy these, or do I can’t stop you."
76,4,Great set of Wireless Earbuds,"Pros: Great sound quality and good battery lifeCons:  recommend getting a case for them the pack gets scratches and the writing on them is wearing off from being in my pocket, the door on the battery pack seems to be getting a little loose, every once in a while i have a connection issue witch is fixed by just reopening the battery pack."
77,5,Best wireless headphones,Bought these for my son for christmas. He likes these better then his airpods and they were half the price. This gift was a hit!
78,5,Perfect for playing STEPMANIA DDR wirelessly!,"Main reason I got this was because of the ""LOW LATENCY CONNECTION"" advertised.To get it just right for STEPMANIA my settings were:-Paired to PC with ""game mode"" setting-Under settings in STEPMANIA go to ""Graphics/Sound Options""-Scroll down to ""Visual Delay""-Set it to ""+1"" and your ready to go!"
79,5,Comparable to air pods,Definitely worth the money. Same quality and maybe even better sound quality when gaming. and its $50 less than air pods
80,5,Great buds for the price!,"Good buds, can't really stand the in ear buds and own a pair of Power Beats Pro.  I can wear these for a while and get no ear pain.  Sound quality is great for the price.  Case is awesome.  Only missing wireless charging, but good buds for the price."
81,4,Good quality for competitive price,These are great earbuds and have a competitive price against AirPods.They connect great to my phoneThey have great sound quality after using the app to bass boost them.My only complaint is the limited customization within the app.
82,3,A Month After Purchased....,"After a month of use, they always have bad frequency with your phone, meaning that it would cut off audio or become static. Recently the audio quality went down significantly and know doesn't play as loud as before. I have to turn up my volume to the max to have mediocre audio."
83,5,Easy listening,"I bought these for my son, he really loves them he use them both for his laptop and his phone."
84,2,Hell NO even at discounted price!,They sound so cheap that at first I thought I have to reset them or the connection. After trying all the possibilities I confirm that they are the worst sounding wireless earbuds among the lot I tried. Disappoinment in abundance!
85,3,Weak bass,"I bought these because a review I read in a magazine said they had great bass response and worked well for music.  They don't have great bass response.  My $17 wired headphones are much better for that.  Otherwise they sound very good, but I'm disappointed."
86,3,Wish Razer would put weights in them to at least make them FEEL quality.,"Lighter and cheaper feeling than I had hoped. Doesn't have that Razer quality I'm used to in their other products, but they're decent. It's a lot of money for decent, but if you want something to match your Razer phone, that's all you got."
87,5,Razer Hammerhead True Wireless,My son took them from me. He loves them because I can't get them back
88,5,Great price for fantastic headphones!!,"I have an iPhone and got these instead of AirPod and let me tell you, these have more functions than AirPod. However the bass isn’t as nice as the AirPods but if you can live with a little less bass than these are the headphones for you!"
89,5,Better than apple,Best value and great quality
90,3,Razer steals money. Not love for being a good product,"Type C. Different size ear tips; problem is with the connection. It's easy to disconnect and distort from my experience compared to airpods. For the price point, it wasn't worth it. Also have prior experience w razer not being customer friendly when something doesn't work as expected. Don't do it."
91,5,Airpods for android. Excellent.,"I have tried multiple true wireless headphones and if you want something like airpods for android, look no further. These sound great, have decent bass and are comfortable in the ear. The sound syncs with the video very well even without the gaming mode but it's nice to have. Couple iffy things... The plastic feels cheap for a $100 item but they are so light that I don't even mind it. I can't even feel them in my ear. The touch controls are not the best but maybe that can be fixed in a firmware update. Also 2 stars for the noise cancellation, but let's be honest, these are an airpods type design so you will not be buying them for the noise cancellation. Overall I'm satisfied and impressed. Thanks, Razer!"
92,4,"For $100, you cant go wrong.","Purchased these on a whim when I saw they were $100. Carrying case is very portable. They are NOT noice cancelling so if that is a deal breaker, these are not for you. There is also no volume control on the buds. I knew those cons going in so I was not surprised. Takes a few listens to break them in because fresh out the box the treble was sharp.Now the bass is really pronounced. When listening on iOS devices, there are no latency issues but when using other devices a notice it a lot. However, it can be corrected using the ""gaming mode"" feature these come with that reduce latency."
93,5,"Great sound, Quality product","Great earbuds. They work really well, and rhe gaming mode is useful when connections are not rhe best. They obviously arent as good as headphones, but they surpass any ear buds supplied with a phone. The battery lasts long enough to have a comfortable amount of music or vidieos, and they seem unnoticable after wearing them for a while."
94,3,HONEST CUSTOMER REVIEW,"These headphones are great in terms of sound quality, comparable if not better than Apple AirPods. My only issue with these earbuds are that they do not fit the average ear, there is no way this is supposed to comfortably fit someones ear for more than an hour without causing sores or ear pain. I have had them for one day, and I couldn't stand wearing them for more than an hour and a half while studying. Periodically, while listening to music or watching a video, the sound would have a little cut with a robotic audio being played from both earbuds. I tried troubleshooting them, but no fix. I am returning these earbuds, simply because they're too large and because of the periodic audio cut."
95,3,Kinda cheap plastic,"The sound is good, the buds have a good fit for the most part, and battery life is good enough that I don't need to think about it. However, the case has a very cheap, light feeling to it. Its only been a few weeks since I've used this and my case is already showing tiny cracks. The lid pops and clicks and sounds like its breaking every time I open it. The earbuds themselves have a similar light, cheap plastic feeling to them."
96,2,"Sound okay, but there is stutter","The buds sound okay to me, but being used to Sony over-ears make these sound a bit odd at first. With the right ear shape it would not hurt much, but without the rubber tips the plastic could get uncomfortable. There is basically no noise isolation, but not transparent enough for casual conversation. And these are loud.The battery life is not great, but with a small case and a universal type-c charging cable it is quite impressive.The problem is that when you cup over your ears, the buds would stutter. I do no know if it's because mine is a faulty unit, the firmware got it wrong or whatever, but I would cut my music just by closing my hands around the buds."
97,1,Absolute Garbage,"Absolute garbage. Was super excited to get these. The ""button"" you press to operate these things is fidgety at best. The blue tooth connection is weak and spotty as hell. I would get 1 to connect and play sound. Have to troubleshoot the 2nd ear bud and then the other would drop sound. In addition, the sound would cut in and out. Forget moving my head, any movement cause blue tooth connection issues. I love Razer. But wtf is this garbage. DO NOT BUY!!!"
98,4,Not perfect but still very good headphones,"I’m very happy with these, I used to have Apple AirPods but they got stolen and the new ones are too expensive for my taste, these were right in my price range especially for Black Friday, I am beyond happy with the sound quality, the only complaint I have is that the tap features don’t work through my hoodie when I’m at work and they also constantly feel like they are falling out, they never have yet but they just feel as if they are, all in all 4 stars, would recommend if you like the original AirPods"
99,2,Meh,"I could understand why one would buy earbuds like this, because it does not go all the way into the ear. With that being said, there's no noise cancellation when listening to anything. The sound quality is mediocre at best and the sound does not really pack a punch. I would like if these were waterproof but there is little to no lag when playing videos, especially on gaming mode. For the price, I expect more than what was given."
100,5,Its AWESOME. i wish they make a case for it,These are amazing. I get good connection and it does last awhile. But after close to low battery the connection started to get bad but only for a sec it also happened once. For me they dont sound loud but you can hear everything clearly and i cant here no one while i have them on. I just hope they make a case for these.
101,5,Great for the Price,"I didn’t expect an absolutely amazing pair of ear buds, I heard great things about these and for the price I decided to try them out. What I didn’t expect was to use these as my daily driver. I love them, sure there are better pairs out there but for the price I would recommend."
102,4,What i was looking for,"(UPDATE) AFTER USING THE HEADPHONES I STILL LOVE THEM HOWEVER!, AFTER LOOKING ON THE PACKAGE AND AD I REALIZED I WAS SUPPOSED TO GET SILICON SLEEVES THAT I DID NOT GET. The headphones are solid, and exactly what i was expecting. The case felt a little flimsy as far as the lid was concerned but over all 👌"
103,5,Great Audio Quality,"The audio quality of this little boys is amazing, I know is not the same as a AirPods but it is not a huge difference to be honest, it was easy to pair it with my phone & laptop, again is not an AirPod but the quality is decent, if you are a student/gamer you will love this product from Razer."
104,4,Dope sound great price!,"These Razer hammerheads are really good! I was not expecting them to sound so damn good! Bass was not too overbearing, over all good clean sound. If your looking for premium headphone quality and sound without the premium price you shouldn't be looking anything else but these!"
105,2,There are better things out there,These headphones are pretty bad the battery life is super low and I keep experiencing random disconnects. The sound quality is extremely bad. They mute your audio when you're trying to game and use the mic at the same time which makes it unusable while gaming.
106,2,Only came with one gel covering,"It only came with one of the gel coverings for the right earbud not for left earbud. Whonh whonhhhhh! Also, the wrist band would not fit on my hand (which is small for a man's hand already) if my hand was 1/2 the size. Did they make this for a hobbit?!"
107,4,Must Buy For All Razer Phone Users,Good goes great with my razer phone! Light and clear sound!
108,5,"Awesome for audio, bad for calls",Great sound and fit. Killer features but bad for taking calls
109,5,Good item,Like them alot
110,4,Good First Try for Razer on TWS Earphones,"For the style of earphones, I know these will leak sound in so noise cancellation is nonexistent in this case. Compared to other headphones with this style, I love the sound and and it’s louder than most of the other ones with good bass. The case lid felt wobbly at sliding it with my finger but the whole thing itself is durable since I dropped it twice and I had no issues with it. Battery life needs improvement and I wish there were volumes controls on the earbuds. I don’t know if it’s the software but the taps are a bit too long to be called taps. They feel like long presses and the buttons are small so the earphones dig into my ear when tapping. I also think that the wrist strap should be a little bit bigger so that it fits more hands"
111,4,"Amazing audio quality, poor fit (subjective based on ear shape)","Possibly the best true wireless earbuds at this price point. The sound quality is incredible with rich bass that doesn't overpower clear mids and highs. They would have gotten five stars if not for the design. I really dislike ""Airpod style"" buds that hang from your ears rather than inserting into your ear with either silicone or foam tips. These just don't hang on as well, and it's entirely due to variances in ear shape. Your mileage as far as fit goes will vary. If AirPods don't fit you, these probably won't either. I like using them as a throw in your bag and go pair of buds for being out and about, but I don't recommend them for exercise since they don't stay in well, despite being sweat resistant."
112,5,Great overall,"Never liked the look or stigma associated with AirPods, so when Razer released these at a good price (not common for them), I figured they would be worth a shot. And boy are these worth it. Great for gym time, movies, gaming, whatever. I don’t mobile game at all, but the low latency “gaming mode” makes videos much less frustrating to watch with an audio delay. High quality engineering, and very good, user friendly software, WITH silicon grips on the buds if you want them"
113,2,Terrible Bluetooth,"Let me start by saying, I really like these headphones they fit my ears perfect, and the sound quality is pretty decent. However, the Bluetooth connectivity is TERRIBlE!I'm using these with the RazerPhone2 and any time I put my phone in my pocket the audio instantly becomes choppy or just completely stops working. RAZER please fix your product!"
114,3,I'm disappointed,"I was so looking forward to these. I bought them and got them out of the package and tested them only to find out the volume on it was weird (my bluetooth volume was maxed and the headphones were outputting 50% of volume). So I let them charge for 1 whole hour, disconnected them, restarted my phone and did it again. Same issue persisted. Next, I let them charge all night, did the same thing and not only did they not work properly, they did not fully charge my earbuds. On top of the sound, they did not fully charge my earbuds and I placed them as perfect as I can. I'm disappointed and hope in future, they can fix these issues. Presentation looks good though."
115,4,Good headphones that could be improved for next generation.,"Had these for about 2 weeks and came from using AirPods, they work better than the Airpods did with my Galaxy Note 9. The case to headphones could be better, the top of it is kinda flimsy. The battery life is decent just 1 hour less than the AirPods. The bluetooth could be better, when outside in the open the connection can be shoddy if phone is in the pocket. Overall for price point pretty good headphones."
116,5,These are epic!,"i ordered the anker soundcore liberty air 2 before these and had to return them. i imaged those would be much better sounding as they are in ears. they did most definitely not. these blew me away sound wise. the ankers would fall out of my ear and hurt my ear. these are super comfortable and fit very nice.the case is a bit wobbly though, the lid that is. thats the only part they could improve in my opion. for everything else they are absolutely great. if you have an android phone i would definitely recommend these even for iphone user i guess. i think these sound better then airpods.only thing i would like to see is ability to change the volume with the touch controls. but maybe they will add that in later with an update just like the EQ presets you can now chose from."
117,4,Good enough for daily commute.,"The sound quality is quite ok compares to other wireless earphone. Definitely not as good as the airpod pro but acceptable for around $100. Good bass, trebe a little weird but I get used to it by time. Good, stable connection with phone but not so stable with laptop.Overall I am happy with this purchase, suite my needs for daily basis."
118,3,Sound cuts in and out right out of the box!,"I really liked them however the only conplaint ill give other than there being no noise cancellation is the fact that i got 2 pairs, the initial bought pair and then a second pair that i had to exchange because the first pair was cutting in and out all the time right out of the box and i didnt understand why so i thought the second pair would be better but no they did the exact same thing so i mean idk about anyone else but thats just not alright especially from razer"
119,2,Bad Bluetooth reception quality.,"My honest 2 month usage review:Have been using these hammerhead headphones for 2 months now. Usually connected to my Razer Phone during work hours.Pros:Good battery life - Considering that the case provides some juice when encased.Decent Sound QualityLow to Decent bassCons - Worst Bluetooth reception i have ever seen on any wireless headphones. Move your phone to your pockets, and the signal drops. It struggles to hold a stable connection at arm's length. And considering the fact that i am using Razer Phone 2, i would expect a seemless experience. Nope, nowhere close to it.Verdict: You can probably find a better pair for the price you would be paying for these."
120,5,Feels comfortable in ear,Easily falls out
121,4,Good overall product,"The charging case that comes with the headphones feels pretty light and cheap but the overall quality of the headphones is pretty good. It would be better if it costed less but then again, its a name brand."
122,4,Worth its dollar.,I like the overall product I just thought it would be more noise canceling. I can still hear different things around me.
123,5,Good Sound and Quality,"I have used Airpods in the past but since using these I will never go back. The sound quality is great, they have a gaming sound option. Best earphones."
124,1,Lagging,As soon as I received and pair up. Music cuts off. Too much lag. Any fixes?
125,5,No regrets,"For the price, the quality is much much better than I expected, it's well worth the price and I'd recommend anyone searching for a great experience with some wireless earbuds to try them out."
126,5,They’re Amazing,"I personally use these for streaming on Twitch, the sound quality is insanely good and the fact they offer no delay helps whenever I’m playing any game that’s requiring split second reaction."
127,3,Decent for the price. Made for fanboys.,Fit is like a scaled up AirPod. The material is almost too “matte” finished and I find it sliding out of my ears often.
128,5,Amazing,"Sound quality is amazing. It could use a little more noise cancellation, but otherwise these are phenomenal. Keep up the good work!"
129,5,I love them.,Thank you so much guys.
130,5,Best option out there,Love these. My gf has the AirPods and I got these instead and I like them better. No issues whatsoever
131,5,AMAZING FOR THE PRICE!!,First pair of true wireless earbuds and I have to say wow these blow my mind after listening to them for a month now and they are the best out there and definitely worth the 100
132,4,GG Bois,It's good for gaming
133,5,Great,Love everything about them
134,5,AMAZING,I love the sound quality.  The battery life lasts me all day. And they cancel all the noise during school. Making me able to ignore people and teachers I don't like!
135,5,Noise cancelling is awesome!,"If your looking for an android style AirPods, than these are for you."
136,1,Don't Buy,"These work perfect if you're holding your phone in front of yourself at all times. The minute you put your phone in your pocket, expect connectivity issues."
137,5,Great for the price!,Great earpods for the price. The battery lasts a long time with the case. Sounds great and I am very happy with the purchase.
138,3,Good enough.,Casing is feels cheap and brittle. But sound quality and overall functionality is good.
139,5,"Great product Razer does not disappoint, perfect product if you want alternative to AirPods","Great product, Better then I expected.Connects instantly once paired.Love it Soo far.Great sound quality, won't turn it off"
140,2,So much better out there,"Battery life sucks, they are too big and hurt your ears, they cut in and out.I wouldn't recommend"
141,5,Awesome sound Quality,Awesome sound Quality but for people with small ears as me with the time using them it hurts
142,4,"Good product, but they don't really fit.","These are actually really good earphones. They work well, always have a good connection, good battery life. It's just they don't really for my ears. Now maybe I just have below average ear size and that's why they're so small but other than that they're actually really good."
143,3,Buy Elsewhere,"I was excited to get these earbuds because I had never had completely wireless earbuds before. These sounded fine, I did not need much more and the bass was good. However connectivity was laggy and bad. There are plenty of earbuds better than this and for less money."
144,5,Another good Razer product.,"While it doesn't have noise cancellation, they go loud enough that it doesn't matter. Sound better than airpods and the battery lasts long enough for me."
145,5,Great quality!,They fit really nice in my ear. I like how I can adjust the quality of sound whether it focuses on the treble or bass. I also like how they’re noise cancelling and just how long they last. I can have them in my ears for hours and the sound quality stays consistent.
146,2,Uncomfortable,"It just really hurts my ears, highly uncomfortable. I tried to ignore the pain the head phones being but it was just too much. Much more worth just buying a 25 dollar pair of gaming earbuds"
147,5,Best earbuds I have ever used,"I have been on the hunt for a good set of true wireless earbuds for a year, these fit every want I could have asked for. My wife is now considering letting go of her apple earbuds for a pair of these."
148,5,Good stuff,Works perfect I like it.
149,4,Battery only issue👍.,"Listen to music a lot on the daily. They fit good in my ear, sound was good. Only problem was battery life which was too short for my liking. Got about 3.5hrs per earbud. I would use one at a time to extend usage. Not that bad of a purchase."
150,2,Not to great,I am a huge racer fan and own a few of their products. Didn’t sound that great and felt clunky and rushed. I switched to AirPods on android and they worked just as well if not better.
151,1,Uncomfortable not clear sound,It's not like an android earphone. But it's not bad if your into apple type style earphones. And it hurts the inside of my ears like they're uncomfortable to wear and feels like they are falling out even with the rubber piece.
152,5,Great buy,"I love all Razer products, I have a Mouse and Keyboard,Mouse Pad and a pair of Razer Kraken Headphones. I just needed wireless earphones so these are well made for something so small, definitely should get them"
153,4,Incomplete after-sales service,"It's easy to use, but it's also easy to lose. I lost a headset the first week I bought it. And neither the warranty nor razer officials could provide me with a way to buy my missing headphones."
154,4,Nice quality for cost!,"The audio quality was outstanding for the price, very good comfort fit, battery life is only about 3 hours before needing recharge. I believe the case hold about 17 hours in it."
155,5,It was a gift for someone else.,This was a gift for someone else.
156,3,Get different ear buds,They are not noise cancelling and they lag often
157,5,Good sound,Sounds good 👍
158,3,"Sounds great, but...",I love these ear buds. They connect so quick and sound amazing but they do not work very well with a mac book. If someone has some insight on this let me know but they do work great with phones.
159,5,Amazing,The sound quality and almost zero latency are amazing. Absolutely love these.
160,4,Wanted to love them,I really enjoyed these. The only problem I had is with apple product like designs they hurt my ears. Other than that I loved these headphones
161,5,Pretty good earbuds,"Over all I actually enjoy using these earbuds, I do think it’s great for when I need alone time to my thoughts when in public"
162,5,A good purchase,Better to buy it on Amazon then on Razer's own site.
163,4,Great headset...mediocre battery life,Great earbud battery life not that great though.
164,5,Great quality - stay in ears and don't hurt ears to wear them,Works great!
165,5,Very impressive for the price,They sound good and work well and they don’t block loud noses in the gym. But they’re great for the price and sounds quality
166,5,Must cop. Worth the Hundo,Floss Recommend these. Wasn't disappointed
167,5,Really good if what you care about is sound quality,"It is really good, the only problem is that the case is very cheap and scratches really easily."
168,3,Biggest than others,Really good sound and battery lifeBut those earphones aren't comfortableThey're not like apple earpods
169,5,Greatest earbuds I've tried.,Amazingly perfect earbuds! Was amazing enough for me to throw my airpods pro for it.
170,4,Good sound but uncomfortable,Not very comfortable for long periods of time.
171,4,Would buy again,"Amazing headphones, fit my ear and sound as good as AirPods"
172,5,Get these,👌
173,5,Worth it,Worth the price and love the size of the case. Fits in your pockets.
174,5,It's razer so be prepared,To me they worked perfectly don't know about you
175,5,No lag as using wired earphone,If you want to play game that's it
176,5,Love these,Works perfectly for PC gaming and listening to music at work.
177,1,Waste of time and money.,Most uncomfortable buds ever had.
178,5,Pretty good,"Pretty good, took a while for my ears to get used to the shape though."
179,5,Good product but needs improvement,Amazing sound quality but not enough battery life
180,5,nice,would buy again
181,5,Los mejores audífonos,Me encantaron!
182,4,Not bad,They are cool
183,5,None,Price is good
184,5,Good AirPod alt,Love razed.
185,5,Bangin,These slap
186,4,0ud 9gc,oggcig oh
187,5,tg,good
188,5,Amazing,Nice
189,5,Very good buds,"A very good set of buds.  I'll mention the style thing first because, hey, you're wearing these.  They have a bit of attitude to them which appeals to me, though they aren't in-your-face.  It's more subtle, and with the Razer logo they will be familiar to fellow gamers.However, looks are meaningless without performance, and these buds have it.  Pairing is ultra simple, and inputs (touch, etc) behave as expected.  Now true, they aren't as seamlessly integrated in iOS as AirPods would be, but then these aren't them.  :)  This said, there's not much that my AirPods do that these cannot, at least for 95% of what I use buds for.Sound quality is very very good.  Major thing here is to set expectations...I mean, these are ear buds.  They aren't going to rival big floor speakers.  Even at that, I was very impressed with the sound.  When playing Bioshock, I found performance to be, well, excellent.  Again, given the form factor.A slight point - the fit may NOT offer the best seal in the world against outside noise.  While the earbud sleeves help, they didn't give me a 100% seal.  Some of this may be my odd ear shape, but this said I found some aftermarket tips that work.In sum though - I think these are great.  Good sound for buds, design is great (they are a bit light in construction, but there's a line between weight and comfort that Razer has to straddle), and performance is significantly above par.  A very good set of buds."
190,5,Good bluetooth earphones,These have been my day drivers for headphones and haven't been disappointed since.
191,4,Fits in ear poorly,"I like the sound quality its great, but it falls out of my ear sometimes I used the earbuds mainly for gaming"
192,4,Stiff with no option to change ear piece,I don’t like how they fit in the ear. They hurt my ear canal. There is no option to change it.
193,2,"Great look, horrible quality",The sound quality is terrible compared to other earbuds. Don't buy it unless you want it for its good look.
194,1,Hurts my ears,They hurt my ears really bad I had to return them because if it. Other than that they sound and work great.
195,4,Thumbs up from me,Overall pretty nice headphones the charging case feels a little cheap though
196,3,Big ears only,I did not like how the hammerheads did not have a good Seal and they are made for people with big ears
197,2,They are not very comfortable to use,the sound is not very good
198,5,Nice earpods,"Compact and easy to connect with iPhone, battery life will be checked after useI like it"
199,4,Great,Only thing is I cannot connect to a certain device.
200,4,"A nice pair of wireless earbuds, not enough to justify the price","First impression, good sounds, good battery life, they stay on your ears really well without being uncomfortable. The earbuds position in the case is odd (left bud on the right, right bud on the left), but it's less of a problem than I expected, actually isn't even a problem at all for me.It's not a sound canceling pair. It's made so that you can still hear things going on around you unless you're blasting music at the highest volume possible, probably risking your hearing in the future. Maybe a problem for many, not for me because I like to listen to music during work (I'm not supposed to but since this pair is really hidden and my hair is long, it's impossible to find them in my ears without lifting my hair up), the Hammerhead True Wireless is a bliss for me to do so and can still hear people when need to.The wrist strap is a nice addition that I can really appreciate, keep in mind that this thing is rather small. My hands aren't the biggest, more on the medium-small size for a guy, but the strap still struggles to get through and actually pushed back the strap holder thingy first time I put it on (it was not supposed to), and I had to glue the thing back.After a month of usage, I start to find problems with the pair. I dropped the buds a couple of times (they stay on really well but rather easy to take off if moved). Not sure if it's because of that, but the pair started to show more delays (both when playing games and doing general stuff like videos and music). Sounds lag happen more frequently; when listening to music, the song just stutters for 2-3 times before playing normally again; sometimes it starts on one bud before playing on both connected buds again.As good as this thing sounds, it's the same as many other Razer stuffs, they're weak in durability, making this pair not really worth $100 anymore."
201,4,quality for the price,"Simple to use and charge, nice sound and user friendly functions. They fit larger (my husbands) ears a bit better, but work fine in mine too. Compact charging/carrying case and the sound quality is good. There are simple to use functions while they're in use in your ears (like tapping the left here to switch songs, tapping the right ear to pause, etc.) See instruction manual for settings. Very happy with this product and way cheaper than apple ones."
202,1,"Cheap, Plastic Case","Please, do yourself a favor and don't buy these. When Razer announced these, I was happy since I used an Android device and finally seeing an Airpods variant really made me interested in the product and happy. After I bought it, as soon as I opened the case, I knew that the product was cheap and would break very quickly. The plastic feels lightweight and extremely flimsy. The hinge reminded me of those cheap Chromebooks that you can buy for around 100 dollars, so, nonexistent. After only 2 months of owning it, I realized that the hinge on the back started to form cracks leading to the bottom of the case. A little after that, the left earbud just stopped connecting altogether and is officially dead. I think that Razer was doing a good job in trying to release its own competition for Apple's Airpods, but don't buy these unless you plan to be disappointed."
203,3,Not Great for Multiplayer Gaming,"These earbuds are comfortable, they produce good sound, have low latency (fast without lag) and have a good battery life.  The downside is that when you use the mic, they switch from stereo mode to mono mode, (like being on a phone call).  When playing multiplayer games that require constant squad communication and direction sound (like COD), these seriously hamper you one way or another."
204,3,Uncomfortable but good sound,The earbuds are easy to connect and have good sound quality. It's really cool how when I pop out one out of my ear it pauses my music.  They dont lag with the computer.  I don't find the noise cancelling to be very effective but they are earbuds.  These are solid with no rubber comfort pieces.  I find them uncomfortable and have a hard time wearing them for longer periods of time.
205,4,Truly wireless gaming earbuds,"This is truly wireless gaming earbuds. if you're truly a gamer who looking for earbuds sets instead of full-sized headset and want wireless - this is the one for you.BUT, those earbuds got very poor battery when on gaming mode - 2 hours and a few little mins. I'm using this with my Msi gaming laptop and gaming very hard on them and it does serve its intended purpose.Another con to mention is that sadly there's no windows software UI for them so you don't know how many battery time you have left until the voices in the earbuds say that the battery is low...or if you want to change the EQ for your liking as u can do on the iOs platform.Another con, which is quite subjective, is the overall volume which for me was a quite in the ""ok this is not as loud as I would typically like""Overall this is a good product if you're truly gamer who want the best low latency earbuds and thats it's all about actually."
206,4,Really Kicks Out The Music,I’ve had more expensive buds that weren’t as good sounding as these. Shows that quality doesn’t always cost more. The sound is very good and the bass is equally well too. The slick case can be stored really anywhere. I don’t know how to get the wristbands onto the bud holder. Doesn’t say. It should of came connected already. Four Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!!
207,4,Good value for money,"These handsome, well made earbuds seem sturdier than their apple counterparts, harder to dislodge and more secure in the ear.  Sound quality is fine, but noise cancelling feature not as accurate.  I particularly like the recharge method."
208,5,"Buy these, not airpods!","These are amazing! Sound quality is amazing, especially during game play. I have always had issues with ear buds staying in my ears, but not with these. Battery life is great. I have went more than two days without charging. That is with off and on use. I would highly recommend these to anyone who likes quality."
209,1,Uncomfortable and cuts out,These are awful!! They are very uncomfortable. Sound quality is mediocre. We have razer phones and these still kept cutting out the whole time my husband had them on. His phone was in his pocket.
210,5,Great product,Nice product great sound and quality
211,4,Better than AirPods!,This has a amazing look to them and they have very good sound quality.
212,5,Awesome,Excellent. Perfect for gym and library study.
213,5,great earbud,the phone is very good and very good sound quality and the gaming mode helps a lot too
214,1,Bad earbuds,Worst earbuds ever scabbed my ears up and made them bleed
215,5,"Here you go, Razer fans!",Good earbuds for Razer fans.
216,5,No issues,Sound is great
217,5,"Read instructions, but work great",Once we got them paired they are great.
218,5,Decent,They are what you expect. Wireless decent sound. Worth only $99
219,5,Good for players,"Very low latency, good for players."
220,4,Decent,"Great product from Razer, they sound better than airpods but there still not the best sounding earbuds. Worth the price"
221,1,Disappointed,It doesn’t sound loud no more. Only the first week of usage. Im returning them.
222,5,Great quality,Like
223,5,Great wireless ear buds,"The headphones have great battery life with the case as a built in battery bank basically, allowing for what feels like endless hours of use. Noise cancelling is about what you could expect from ear buds, would definitely recommend."
224,5,Love this product,"Was skeptical at first. Was deciding between the Apple airpods and this but since I'm using an Android phone and liked the black razer design, I went with this instead. I'm very happy with my purchase!"
225,3,Static when using on PC.,Bought these to use with PC and has nothing but static while paired.
226,4,Easy to use.,"I like how they auto sinc to each other and to the phone, also, the game mode is great, no lag between visuals and the audio. Very impressive. The sound wasn't quite what I was hoping for, but still quite good."
227,5,Nice,Pretty good so far. Sound volume seemed very low at first. Connected to my PC and after that the volume is much higher then out of the box volume with my phone. Comfortable and battery life seems very good.
228,4,Great for the price,"The lid for the charging case could be held on a little better and made of slightly better material but other than that, the quality for what you pay is all there. Sound, work, and look great for the price"
229,5,It’s ok,Not comfortable to wear in my ear but it was a good price feel cheap tho
230,5,Great Earbuds for Android and iPhone,"Been using these on my iPhone 11 with the TW Hammerhead app and they have been working out quite well for me. Haven't really tried the game mode yet, so I can't comment on it. The battery life have been fantastic and seems to last longer that the 3 hours they advertise. For me, after trying out airpods, they seem to work quite a bit better as I can easily use them with other devices. Overall, I am quite pleased with these buds (and also with the colour choice!)."
231,5,"Fit like Airpods, but with better sound quality","I have Soundcore LIberty Air and Apple's Airpods. These fall in the middle. Let me explain.Airpods were great because of their (near) bullet-proof pairing and easy fit into your ear without blocking out everything. For me, the problem with Airpods is that they don't seal very well and so aren't loud enough in many environments.The Soundcore pair nearly as well and seal very well. That makes them better for loud environments. And the sound quality is notably better, especially the bass. But they have the same virtues/drawbacks of other earbuds that seal in your ear. They can be tricky to get in and they can shut out the environment a little TOO well. Great for planes, not so good on the street.The Hammerhead strikes an interesting medium. They are shaped like the Airpods, making insertion easy. They are slightly larger with ab outer flange that provides just a bit more of a seal than the Airpods without completely shutting out the environment the way the Soundcores do.The Hammerheads are also louder than the Airpods, which is very welcome. And pairing was very easy.A couple of nits. The case is slippery, like the Airpods case. This is a surprisingly big problem with both. I have dropped both and watched the earbuds scatter on dropping more than once. Not great.Second, it is actually hard to open the Hammerhead case. The slim notch is hard to find and smaller than the hinge notch. I can't tell you how many times I've fumbled around trying to open the case, only to fumble the whole thing to the ground due to its slipperiness.That is a real nit though. Currently the balance of good sound quality, easy fitting and solid pairing make these my daily earbuds."
232,4,"Good first revision, needs some tweaks to be perfect","So overall, I really like these earbuds.  I'm just going to point out things that don't come across in the specs.1. The default sound profile is too ""boomy"".  There is a very basic EQ in the app that allows you to boost treble or bass, but boosting the treble then makes the bass too weak.  Razer needs to add finer grained EQ settings.2. The case lid is a bit loose/wobbly.3. The case is very hard to open on the correct side by feel alone.  You'll have to fumble with it, try both sides, or look at it closely to figure out how to open it each time.4. These earbuds are not ""ported"", so they isolate sound more than Airpods do.  I prefer to hear more of the environment, but it's really down to personal preference.5. Battery life reporting behaves very strangely on these earbuds.  On iOS, the earbuds will report 100% battery for 40-50 minutes or so before the battery starts dropping.  And when it does drop, it drops in 10% increments ... AKA it really doesn't update that often.  It's a bit odd and I much prefer how the Airpods report battery, but overall it's not an issue once you know how it works.  I do think the total battery life estimate given by Razer is accurate tho.6. These do not support aptX or aptX LL.  You'd think for gaming earbuds they'd do aptX LL, but nope.7. The right earbud goes on the left side of the case, and the left goes on the right side!  It's also awkward to pick the earbuds out of the case ... they should have added some grooves in the case to make it easier to remove the earbuds as you walk, etc.Now the good news.1.  Gaming mode works on both my iPhone and bluetooth adapters for my Nintendo Switch!  The delay is not perfect, but extremely low compared to most earbuds.  aptX LL probably would have been better, but this is still really good.In gaming mode, the connection will be more prone to breaking up since I assume they are lowering the packet size and decreasing the buffering before playback in the earbuds.  The vast majority of the time, this isn't an issue.  I did see a problem one time when I had the phone in my pocket and was listening to music in gaming mode ... the audio started popping and stuttering.  Switching out of game mode fixed it immediately.2. The touch controls are nice and do more than my Airpods Gen 1 ever did.  Good stuff.  But it takes some time to internalize what all the taps do.Bottom line is ... I like them a lot and I'm going to keep them, as they are a perfect companion to my Switch Lite when I'm out and about.  But there's definitely room for improvement."
233,2,"A real disappointment. Terrible connection, doesn't always connect, and feels cheap.","I should start of by saying I expected much more off of these, after all, they are from Razer. First impressions are pretty good but you will soon realize they are made from very cheap plastic and they leak sound like there is no tomorrow.Pairing is a bit tricky, for me, you have to remove them from their case and then place them back inside why they are attempting to pair or else it will fail to pair. On the other case sometimes they will won't turn on after being removed from the case, making them unusable as holding them turns them on to 'pairing mode' which won't actually connect to your device and make it so you need to remove the headphones from your paired devices on your phone.I was out all day yesterday and could not for the life of me get these to connect, I tried my friend's phone and his failed to pair while mine couldn't even see these. I've had cheap knock-off airpods get this down better than Razer could.When it comes to the material the plastic the case and headphones are made out of have to be the thinnest and creakiest I've ever felt.  If you run your fingers over the headphones you can fell the spots where two piece of plastic don't really join all that well, it just feels like $20 headphones.The connection is the worst part. Want the phone in your pocket? Can't. Want to put your hand on your face while you are listen to music? Sorry, your connection will get lost. My bet is that these are sending a lot more data than the average wireless earbuds as they sound much better and that's really its only saving grace.  When it comes to gaming they are great, but I feel if you buy headphones one should expect them to be all right daily headphones. The range on these are ridiculous and trust me, you will be frustrated on how bad they are. Maybe if you are using the recommended Razer phone you'll have better luck, but out of trying a Umidigi F1, Axon 7, OnePlus One, and a Samsung S4 and my laptop, they all have the same lacklustre problems.I don't expect these to last very long and if anything comes in my hand that is remotely all right they will be replaced immediately. Avoid these if you can."
234,4,"Great sound, a couple of minor annoyances","The sound quality of these is excellent. Since that's the main thing I want in earbuds, these get two thumbs up from me- with a few exceptions- see below.They came fully charged and ready to go. Pairing couldn't have been easier. I took them out of the box, went to Bluetooth settings on my iPhone and BAM, just hit connect and there they were.The bass response is nice. Crisp treble.Now, for the minor annoyances. For some reason the left bud goes into the right side of the case and vice versa. This will take some getting used to. They could have easily solved this issue by putting the hinge on the other side of the case.The case itself is a little slick. I'd prefer some texture so I don't drop it when pulling it out of my pocket.I don't care for the fit in my ears. One of the reasons I never bought any Apple headphones or earbuds is the fact they don't use silicone seals. I find I get a much better bass response with a tight fit. It also seals out noise and makes the earbuds feel secure in your ears. When I push and hold these deeper into my ears, they sound considerably better. The sound would be enhanced if they fit better. The sound, as they sit naturally is rather ""airy"" rather than immersive. They are not going to fit every ear perfectly and they are not at all adjustable.If you like the Apple style of fit, these are wonderful."
235,1,"Well, that didn't work out well.","I did not know how big these ear buds were until I charged them.  They are made for elephants.  There are no pictures of the product being used in the product description so I had no idea how to insert them.  Otherwise, the directions given are good.  I looked through customer images to see how to insert them and I can't figure out how people are using them.  I got a second opinion and that person (a man) could not insert them.  The fact that they don't include an image of people wearing them seems odd.  I have leaving bad reviews but I could not find one good thing to say about this product other than the instructions for charging and pairing are very clear."
236,5,"Easy to connect, good sound quality","These earbuds were super easy to connect to my iPhone.  I've been using a Bose headset for listening to podcasts for years and I wasn't expecting the sound for these earbuds to be anything great, but I was surprised by how good the sound quality is.  I'm not sure they're the best for noise cancellation since I felt like I could hear my kids playing a bit more than I usually can with my Bose headset.  I think these earbuds are pretty decent.  My husband has a set of airpods and he felt like these were pretty close to those in terms of functionality.  I have no complaints about them."
237,4,Good Alternative To Air Pods,The Razer Hammerhead True Wireless Earbuds are a good alternative to Apple Air Pods and are more widely compatible with non Apple devices.  They still work great with Apple Devices too.  The sound quality and fit are fantastic in my opinion.  They have the same basic shape of Air Pods with a slightly lager outer nub on the outside of the buds that have touch controls.  Unfortunately I did not find the touch controls to be very responsive at times.  This is disappointing considering everything else about these earbuds are perfect.  They have a USB-C charging case that auto pairs the buds with your device as soon as you open the case.  The earbuds also came with some silicone covers if you like a more secure fit or use them just to keep your buds clean.
238,4,Works great but I have 2 complaints.,"First of all, the sound is AMAZING! And the work very well! I only have minor issues with these.1. The case hinge is hinda wonky and feels strange when you open and close it or jiggle it around.2. The firmware updates and software in general is only supported in android. Why not Razer Synapse 3? Pairing them in windows is consistent though and you can use game mode on anything.Game mode off in windows gives you about 100ms of latency.Game mode on gives almost NO latency in Windows! (slight latency in Android still)If you just want some good audio quality earbuds that are truly wireless and the fact that you can flex that you have one by razer then this product is for you!"
239,4,Be cautious of wireless,"Earbuds are good quality. BIG PROBLEM is if you misplace one or earbud falls out in a public place, be prepared to have to buy another whole set. Assurion Insurance says no coverage. Amazon says no coverage. the manufacturer Razer has no coverage and what is even worse, they won't sell a single earbud. You have to buy the entire product again. I could see if I had only one foot and wanted to buy one shoe but they are very similar structure wise. Razer does have a parts replacement dept. but not for an earbud. Last resort  but it would have helped would be a pair at wholesale price. This wasn't offered. Poor handling for Customer Service."
